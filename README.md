###Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The approach involves several steps, from data collection to model evaluation and future predictions.

Steps Involved
1. Data Collection
Source: Historical stock data for AAPL is collected from the Tiingo API.
Format: The data includes various fields such as date, open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices.
Output: The dataset is saved in CSV format for further analysis.


3. Data Preprocessing
Data Exploration: Initial examination of the dataset is conducted to understand its structure and identify relevant columns, specifically the 'close' price.
Visualization: The closing prices are plotted to observe historical trends and fluctuations over time.
Normalization: To prepare the data for LSTM, the closing prices are scaled to a range between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This step is crucial as LSTMs are sensitive to the scale of input data.


4. Splitting the Dataset
Training and Testing Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with approximately 65% of the data used for training and 35% for testing. This split ensures the model is trained on a substantial portion of the data while maintaining a separate set for evaluation.


5. Creating Datasets for LSTM
Dataset Preparation: A function is defined to transform the dataset into sequences suitable for LSTM input. This involves creating overlapping windows of data points (e.g., using 100 time steps) for model training.
Reshaping Data: The training and testing datasets are reshaped to fit the expected input format of the LSTM model, which requires three dimensions: samples, time steps, and features.


6. Building the Stacked LSTM Model
Model Architecture: A sequential model is constructed using multiple LSTM layers. The architecture typically includes:
An initial LSTM layer with a specified number of units and the return_sequences parameter to maintain the sequence output for further layers.
Additional LSTM layers to capture more complex patterns in the data.
A final Dense layer that outputs the predicted stock price.


7. Training the Model
Model Compilation: The model is compiled with a loss function (mean squared error) and an optimizer (Adam) to facilitate efficient training.
Model Training: The model is fitted to the training data while using the testing set for validation to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.


8. Making Predictions
Training Predictions: After training, the model is used to predict stock prices for both the training and testing datasets.
Inverse Transformation: Predictions are transformed back to the original scale to facilitate accurate evaluation and comparison with actual prices.


9. Evaluating the Model
Performance Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which quantifies the prediction error for both the training and testing datasets. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictive performance.


10. Visualizing Results
Results Visualization: The actual stock prices are plotted against the predicted prices to visually assess the model's performance. This helps identify how well the model captures trends and patterns in the stock price movement.


11. Future Predictions
Next Steps Prediction: The model is utilized to predict stock prices for the next 30 days based on the last available data point from the testing set. This involves iteratively feeding the model with previous predictions to generate future outputs.
Extended Visualization: Future predictions are visualized alongside the historical data to observe potential future trends in stock prices.


Conclusion
This project showcases the effective application of Stacked LSTMs for forecasting stock prices. By following a structured approach from data collection to model evaluation, it provides valuable insights into stock price trends and establishes a foundation for further exploration in time series forecasting. The methodology can be adapted and expanded for other stocks or financial instruments, potentially incorporating additional features and advanced modeling technique
